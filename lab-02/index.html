        <h1>About Marchael Acode</h1>
          <p>
            I was born in a city up north in Canada near Vancouver called New Westminster. I grew up in a small town called Mount Vernon which is an hour north from Seattle. I am considered to be a physically active nerd. I try to stay on top of my daily exercise as much as I can. My personal hobbies consist of playing videogames, watching anime and now coding!

        <h2>Education History</h2>
          <p>I have a Bachelor of Arts degree in American Ethnic Studies from the University of Washington. Going into college, I thought my path was to become an Eletrical Engineer. After three years of tackling with the program, I came to realize this path wasn't for me. I needed to graduate on time and found that American Ethnic Studies was a facinating program to dive into. I learned a lot about ethnic american culture/history as well as my own native history. After college, I didn't know what I wanted to pursue. I did some soul searching and found my passion lives in gaming and want to pursue my goal to become a game developer. Here I am now at Code Fellows learning about software development, coding langauges and the tech world!</p>

        <h2>Job Experiences</h2>
          <p>My professional experience mostly centers around the restaurant industry. I worked as a server at a Taiwanese dumpling house called Din Tai Fung for 4+ years. From my time at Din Tai Fung, I harnessed my skills of customer service, priortization, patience, thinking and staying on your toes. I also did some admin work at a environmental consulting firm called Cascadia Consulting Group. I was only there for two months because of COVID-19, but it was a exciting and new environment from the restaurant industry.</p>
